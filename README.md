# Hi, I'm Ruchi Giradkar

Cybersecurity Specialist | VAPT & Forensics | Security Architecture

I’m passionate about IT cybersecurity and protecting systems end-to-end.  
My capstone project covered Vulnerability Assessment, Penetration Testing (VAPT), and Digital Forensics—identifying critical risks, safely exploiting real-world vulnerabilities, and recovering hidden evidence to demonstrate a complete attack-to-investigation cycle.

- Continental Automotive — hands-on experience applying ISO/SAE 21434 and TARA methodology to secure automotive systems.
- Bosch (Master’s thesis) — designed a Digital Twin–based Intrusion Detection System for Industry 4.0 connected sensors.
- Currently expanding expertise in IT Cybersecurity, SOC operations, SIEM tooling, and Cloud Security.
