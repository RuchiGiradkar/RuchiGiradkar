# Hi, I'm Ruchi Giradkar üëã  

Passionate about **IT Cybersecurity**, with a focus on protecting systems through end-to-end security practices.  
Completed a **Capstone Project on Vulnerability Assessment, Penetration Testing (VAPT), and Digital Forensics**, where I identified critical risks, exploited real-world vulnerabilities, and recovered hidden forensic evidence to demonstrate complete attack-to-investigation coverage.  
Gained hands-on experience at **Continental Automotive**, applying **ISO/SAE 21434** and **TARA methodology** to secure automotive systems.  
Completed my **Master‚Äôs thesis at Bosch**, where I developed a **Digital Twin‚Äìbased Intrusion Detection System** for Industry 4.0 connected sensors.  
Currently expanding expertise in **IT Cybersecurity, SOC Operations, SIEM Tools, and Cloud Security**.
